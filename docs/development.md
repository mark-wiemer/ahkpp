# Development

This document covers the development process, from writing code to publishing a new version.

> Throughout the document, `F1` is short for Show all commands / Open [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/ux-guidelines/command-palette)

## Environment

-   Node 22
-   npm 11

## Writing

1. Write your change on any branch other than `main`
1. Merge each change to `main` via a squash-commit PR

## Testing

-   Test all added commands
-   If the readme was modified, confirm it appears as intended in a non-GitHub viewer (Ctrl+Shift+V in VS Code is sufficient)

Unit tests are in files named `*utils.test.ts` and they test corresponding files named `*utils.ts`.

### Launch Extension troubleshooting

In the Run and Debug viewlet, the "Launch Extension" config is best for manual testing. [\_readme.md](../demos/manualTests/_readme.md) covers how those tests work.

## Starting a release

Unless otherwise specified, commit messages don't matter.

1. Create a new branch with name e.g. `release-1.2.3` or similar. Don't use e.g. `v1.2.3`, that's used as a tag later.
1. Update the changelog.
1. Bump the version in `package.json`
1. Run `npm i` to update `package-lock.json`
1. Commit the changes.
1. Open a PR. For consistency, the title of the PR should be e.g. `1.2.3 - 2020-12-31 ❄️`. The PR description should contain the changelog entry, including the heading for this version.
1. Go to `https://github.com/mark-wiemer/ahkpp/compare` to review all changes since last release.
1. Fix any remaining issues with the PR.
1. Merge the PR. Commit message should be the changelog heading + PR number, e.g. `1.2.3 - 2020-12-31 ❄️ (#456)`
1. `git checkout main && git pull && npm run package`
1. Install the new version:
    1. Select the newly-created `.vsix` file.
    1. Open the context menu (right-click).
    1. Select `Install Extension VSIX`.
    1. Reload the window. (`F1` -> Developer: Reload Window)
1. Validate that the vsix includes the readme, license, and changelog visible in the IDE's extension view ([#537](https://github.com/mark-wiemer/ahkpp/issues/537))
1. Ensure all tests pass, including manual ones on the new changes.

### Publishing

1. Tag the release
    1. e.g. `git checkout main && git pull && git tag v1.2.3 && git push origin v1.2.3`
    1. [Create a new GitHub release for this tag](https://github.com/mark-wiemer/ahkpp/tags)
        1. Release title: Same as in [changelog.md](../changelog.md)
        1. Description: Changelog entry, excluding the heading for this version
        1. Attach binary
        1. Publish release

When the tag is pushed, changes will automatically be published by the [deploy workflow](https://github.com/mark-wiemer/ahkpp/actions/workflows/deploy.yml).

### Validating deployment

1. [Deploy workflow](https://github.com/mark-wiemer/ahkpp/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)
1. [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mark-wiemer.vscode-autohotkey-plus-plus)
    1. [Publisher view](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage/publishers/mark-wiemer): validation takes about 5 minutes
1. [Open VSX Marketplace](https://open-vsx.org/extension/mark-wiemer/vscode-autohotkey-plus-plus)
