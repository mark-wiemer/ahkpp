# Localization

AHK++ was forked from two Chinese developers: cweijan for AHK v1 support, and
thqby for AHK v2 support. It's now maintained by Mark Wiemer, who does not speak
Chinese at all.

Translations for new text are handled via
[DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/en/translator) and manually pasted into
`package.nls.zh-cn.json` and other relevant files as needed.

Contributions are welcome for Chinese or any other language! Feel free to
[start a discussion](https://github.com/mark-wiemer/ahkpp/discussions/new?category=q-a)
if you have any questions.
